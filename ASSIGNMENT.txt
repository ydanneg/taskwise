Your homework assignment is to write a program that implements a basic tasks management system using either Java or Kotlin language with any frameworks or tools.
The program should have a web API, but it is not necessary to create a user interface.

The program should allow users to create new tasks, assign them to registered team members, and track their progress.
The tasks should have a title, description, due date, priority, and assigned team member.
Users should be able to update the task status, mark tasks as complete, and view the task details. Feel free to add more field and use cases to demonstrate your creativity.

In addition, the program should include basic reporting features that provide an overview of task completion by period of time or team member.
This should include the ability to generate reports in JSON format, showing details such as the number of tasks completed and the average time to complete tasks.

We appreciate if you write write you program following clean code principles, and the code is covered with unit tests to ensure the program's functionality and reliability.
To accomplish this task, you may use any libraries, frameworks, or tools that you are familiar with.
